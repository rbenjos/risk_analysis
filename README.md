# Risk analysis:

The following is all my work done for fsight.
The main folder contains all of the python files used to process the primaries and actuals given to it.
usualy the order of processing is as follows:

```simplifying -> dividing -> aggregating -> (renaming if needed) -> rankning -> rating```

each step has its own separate program, the piplining is done through the batch files in the 'batfiles' directory.

additionaly, I included the ipynb notebooks used for devloping these programs and the ones presented in the meetings.
they include the code for the visualizations, all in the 'notebooks' directory
